h3. Albumdy is an open source photo gallery built with Ruby on Rails and jQuery using some of my favorite plugins and practices.

h3. A live demo is available at "www.albumdy.com":http://www.albumdy.com

h3. There are many existing photo gallery apps around, but none I could find demonstrating the following key technologies:

  * Built with "Ruby on Rails 2.1":http://www.rubyonrails.org/
  * CSS layout with "Blueprint CSS":http://www.blueprintcss.org/
  * Client side scripting with the popular and unobtrusive "jQuery":http://jquery.com/
  * Lightboxing effects using "Leandro Vieira Pinho's jQuery lightBox":http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/
  * Photo Gallery courtesy of "Galleria":http://devkick.com/lab/galleria/
  * Textboxing effects using "Cody Lindley's ThickBox":http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/
  * Multiple file upload client "SWFUpload":http://swfupload.org/
  * Thin controllers with "James Golick's resource_controller":http://jamesgolick.com/resource_controller
  * File uploads and thumbnail generation with "Thoughtbot's Paperclip":http://www.thoughtbot.com/projects/paperclip
  * File storage with Amazon S3
  * User Registration with "Rick Olson's restful_authentication":http://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication
  * Permalinks (SEO) using "Randomba's friendly_id":http://github.com/norman/friendly_id/tree/master
  * Organized nested routes as described in "Regulators!!! Mount up":http://giantrobots.thoughtbot.com/2008/7/10/regulators-mount-up

h3. You will need the following additional gems installed:

  * sudo gem install mime-types http://mime-types.rubyforge.org/
  * sudo gem install right_aws (If you want to use Amazon S3 for storage, although paperclip + S3 is a bit slow)

h3. To install and run the app:

  * git clone git://github.com/rapind/albumdy.git
  * go to the application's root directory I.e. cd ~/Sites/albumdy
  * rename / copy the database.yml.sample to database.yml and enter your database information (I.e. cp config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml)
  * gem install unicode
  * gem install iconv
  * Install the gems: "unicode" and "iconv"
  * rake db:create
  * rake db:migrate
  * rake db:bootstrap
  * script/server
